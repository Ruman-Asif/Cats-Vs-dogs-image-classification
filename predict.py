# In this example, you preprocess the new image, normalize its pixel values,
# and convert it to a NumPy array. Then, you use the
# trained model to predict the class of the new image
# by calling model.predict() on the preprocessed image
# array. Finally, you convert the prediction to a class
#     label based on the threshold of 0.5 (assuming the model predicts
#     class 0 for cats and class 1 for dogs), and print the predicted class label.
#
# Make sure to replace 'path/to/new_image.jpg' with the
#     actual path to your new image.
#
# Note that the model expects input images in the
# same format as the training images, such as resizing to
# (img_width, img_height) and normalizing pixel values.
